This appendix contains all the graphs and the tables related to the read experiments conducted, and of the comparison with the related work. Results are reported first expressed as latency (measured in seconds) and then as throughput (measured in rows/seconds). Latency was directly measured, while throughput was computed from the latency and table size.
