This Chapter is the output of both system evaluation processes defined in Section~\ref{sec:system_evaluation_hudi_iceberg}--\ref{sec:system_evaluation_iceberg_delta}. It starts with Section~\ref{sec:major_results}, which presents the results of both the experiments and the comparison in tables, histograms, and written descriptions. Then, Section~\ref{sec:results_analysis_discussion} complements the chapter by analyzing and discussing the major findings.
