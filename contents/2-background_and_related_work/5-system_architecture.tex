This Section describes the architectures of the legacy, based on Hudi the system implemented during this thesis work, based on Iceberg, and the system implemented in a related thesis work \cite{manfrediReducingReadWrite2024}, based on Delta Lake. Those are the system that will be run and measured in teh experimental part of this thesis work. This Section is divided into six Subsections, according to the system and the operation run over it. For each Subsection, a chart presents the operation protocol step by step.
