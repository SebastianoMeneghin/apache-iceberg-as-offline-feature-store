This chapter defines two methodologies that will be applied sequentially in this project, answering the two \glspl{RQ} defined in Section~\ref{subsec:researchQuestion}. Section~\ref{sec:system_integration} defines the system integration process that outputs part of \gls{D}~3, i.e., the integration detail. This output will enable the new system evaluation defined in Section~\ref{sec:system_evaluation}, which will output \gls{D}~1, i.e., the results of the experiments. Part of \gls{D}~1 will enable the comparative system evaluation, still defined in Section~\ref{sec:system_evaluation}, which will output \gls{D}~2, i.e.,the results of the comparative experiments. The analysis of \gls{D}~1-2 will be delivered in \gls{D}~3, i.e. this comprehensive thesis report.
