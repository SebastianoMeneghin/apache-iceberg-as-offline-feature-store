This chapter defines two methodologies that will be applied sequentially in this project, answering the two \glspl{RQ} defined in Section~\ref{subsec:researchQuestion}. Section~\ref{sec:system_integration} defines the system integration process that outputs part of \gls{D}~3, i.e., the integration detail. This output will enable the Hudi vs. Iceberg system evaluation defined in Section~\ref{sec:system_eval_hudi_iceberg}, which will output \gls{D}~1, i.e., the results of the experiments. The Iceberg experiment results (\gls{D}~1-partial) will enable the Iceberg vs. Delta Lake system evaluation, defined in Section~\ref{sec:system_eval_iceberg_delta}, which will output \gls{D}~2, i.e.,the results of the comparative experiments. The analysis of \glspl{D}~1-2 will be delivered in \gls{D}~3, i.e. this comprehensive thesis report.
