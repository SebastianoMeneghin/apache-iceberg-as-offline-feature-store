The project is conducted in collaboration with Hopsworks AB, and as such the implementation will focus on working with their feature store and related system, supported by \gls{HopsFS}. The considerations drawn in this thesis provide an insight into Spark limitations, and on which tools perform better in different data scales. However, those results cannot be generalized for any system.
