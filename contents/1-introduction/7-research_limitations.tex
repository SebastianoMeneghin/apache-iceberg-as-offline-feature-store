The project is conducted in collaboration with Hopsworks \gls{AB}, and as such the implementation will focus on working with their feature store and related system, supported by \gls{HopsFS}. The consideration drawn from these provides an insight into Spark limitations, and on which tools perform better in different data scales. However, those results cannot be generalized for any system.
