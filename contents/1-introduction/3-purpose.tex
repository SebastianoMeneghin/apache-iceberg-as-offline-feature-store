\generalExpl{Distinguish between purpose and goal! Purpose is to change something for the better. In thesis work there are often two aspects to this. On the one hand, the problem owner (the company) wants to have its problem solved for the better, but academia and the engineering community also want to gain new experiences and knowledge. Describe a purpose that satisfies both these aspects.
There is also another purpose that may be worth considering and that is that you as a student will graduate and you will have to prove, in your thesis, that you fulfill the degree objectives. These objectives coincide with the course objectives of the thesis course.\\
State the purpose of your thesis and the purpose of your degree project.\\
Describe who benefits and how they benefit if you achieve your goals. Include anticipated ethical, sustainability, social issues, etc. related to your project. (Return to these in your reflections in Section~\ref{sec:reflections}.)}
