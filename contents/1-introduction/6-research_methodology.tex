\generalExpl{This is where you specify the overall research strategy or methodology you will use to try to answer the academic question and at the same time solve the original problem. Often you can use “solving the original problem” as a case study of an academic question. You investigate some interesting issue in a “live” situation and gather results and experience from this.
Keep in mind that sometimes the company has to stand back in its desire and expectation of the project outcome in favor of new or complementary engineering experience and science (your thesis). It is you as a student who decides and solves the distribution between these two interests but make sure that everyone is informed. 
Introduce your choice of methodology/methodologies and method/methods – and the reason why you chose them. Contrast them with and explain why you did not choose other methodologies or methods. (The details of the actual methodology and method you have chosen will be given in Chapter~\ref{ch:method}. Note that in Chapter~\ref{ch:method}, the focus could be research strategies, data collection, data analysis, and quality assurance.)\\
In this section you should present your philosophical assumption(s), research method(s), and research approach(es).}
