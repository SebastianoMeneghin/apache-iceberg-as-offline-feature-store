Chapter~\ref{ch:background_and_related_work} provides to readers the basic information needed to understand the layered data stack analyzed in this study. Additionally, it presents the legacy and novel system architectures that will be used in the experiments. Chapter~\ref{ch:method} delineates the methodologies for the system integration and the system evaluations. Chapter~\ref{ch:implementation} illustrates the decisions made during the system selection phase and describes the design of the experiments. Chapter~\ref{ch:results_and_analysis} presents the results of the experiments, focussing on the differences between the described pipelines, with various \gls{CPU} settings. The chapter includes a discussion Section describing the major findings and implications of this thesis. Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusions_and_future_work} eventually summarises the contributions and discoveries of this thesis, highlights its limitations, and sets the discussion on prospective future research.
