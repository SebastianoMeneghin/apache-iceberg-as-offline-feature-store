Chapter~\ref{ch:background_and_related_work} provides readers with the basic information needed to understand the layered data stack analyzed in this study. Additionally, it presents the legacy and novel system architectures that will be used in the experiments.

Chapter~\ref{ch:method} delineates the methodology for the system selection and the system evaluation. 

Chapter~\ref{ch:implementation} illustrates the decisions made during system selection phase and describes the design of the experiments.

Chapter~\ref{ch:results_and_analysis} presents the results of the experiments, focussing on the differences between the described pipelines and the various \gls{CPU} settings, as well as results of related works. The chapter includes a discussion section that allows readers to understand the major findings and implication of this thesis.

Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusions_and_future_work} eventually summarises the contributions and discoveries of this thesis, highlights its limitations, and sets the discussion on prospective future research.
