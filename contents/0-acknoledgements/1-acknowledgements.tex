The completion of this master thesis was only possible thanks to the invaluable support of many, to whom I am deeply grateful.

Many thanks to Jim Dowling, how offered me the opportunity to work on this project and Davit Bzhalava, who supported me along the way. I also had the great pleasure of collaborating with the employees of Hopsworks AB, who generously shared their patience and expertise.

Many thanks to my KTH examiner, Vladimir Vlassov, and my supervisors, Fabian Schmidt and Sina Sheikholeslami, for their guidance in conducting thorough research and for their invaluable feedback.

Heartfelt thanks to my parents and relatives, who have supported me, who have inspired me, who have believed in me, giving me a blank canvas with colors they had never used before. Your wisdom, guidance, and the values you instilled in me have shaped who I am today -- and the person I strive to become in the future.

Lastly, I cannot begin to express my gratitude to the friends who have stood by my side through adventures and challenges. Michele, Daniele, and Davide, for countless years, you offered me advice and challenged my ideas, guiding me towards a clearer understanding of myself. Alfonso, Giacomo, Luca, and Virginia, you made feel like home, at every step of this journey, no matter where we were. Giovanni, you have filled my mind with 'whys' and 'hows' -- questions that helped me grow at every answer, though some still await resolution. Giulia, and all the incredible people from MESA, you have shown me how essential it is to have a cause to believe in and care about. May the future bring us even more time to learn, discover, and laugh -- together.
