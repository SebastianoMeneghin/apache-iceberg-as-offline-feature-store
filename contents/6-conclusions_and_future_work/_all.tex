\engExpl{Discuss the positive effects and the drawbacks.\\
Describe the evaluation of the results of the degree project.\\
Did you meet your goals?\\
What insights have you gained?\\
What suggestions can you give to others working in this area?\\
If you had it to do again, what would you have done differently?}

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
\engExpl{What did you find that limited your efforts? What are the limitations of your results?}


\section{Future work}
\label{sec:futureWork}
\engExpl{Describe valid future work that you or someone else could or should do.\\
Consider: What you have left undone? What are the next obvious things to be done? What hints can you give to the next person who is going to follow up on your work?}



Due to the breadth of the problem, only some of the initial goals have been
met. In these section we will focus on some of the remaining issues that
should be addressed in future work. ...

\subsection{What has been left undone?}
\label{what-has-been-left-undone}

The prototype does not address the third requirment, \ie a yearly unavailability of less than 3 minutes; this remains an open problem. ...

\subsubsection{Cost analysis}
\generalExpl{Example of a missing component}
The current prototype works, but the performance from a cost perspective makes this an impractical solution. Future work must reduce the cost of this solution; to do so, a cost analysis needs to first be done. ...

\subsubsection{Security}
\generalExpl{Example of a missing component}
A future research effort is needed to address the security holes that results from using a self-signed certificate. Page filling text mass. Page filling text mass. ...


\subsection{Next obvious things to be done}

In particular, the author of this thesis wishes to point out xxxxxx remains as a problem to be solved. Solving this problem is the next thing that should be done. ...

\section{Reflections}
\label{sec:reflections}
\generalExpl{What are the relevant economic, social, environmental, and ethical aspects of your work?}



One of the most important results is the reduction in the amount of
energy required to process each packet while at the same time reducing the
time required to process each packet.
